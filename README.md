![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/dotar/InformativeLite/master/screenshot.png)


To be able to use this, you'll *need* the Smartwatch+ app available for jailbroken iOS devices through Cydia.

**The watch app displays:**

• Battery status

• Time

• Date

• Missed calls

• Unread mail

• Unread texts (SMS)

• Weather - temperature (in Celsius) & current condition in text and image form.

All the information is updated dynamically through the Smartwatch+ app.

Smartwatch+ is available through the BigBoss repository on Cydia.
